{\bf Software Engineer},
	Linktree, Collingwood, Vic \hfill August 2019 - September 2020
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 2pt  % reduce space between items

\item Created a security service using the node runtime in AWS Lambda to capture user data, flag actions that violated our ToS and process offending accounts via SQS. The accounts would then be disabled and informed them of the reason they were banned on their next login.

\item Migrated a large portion of our PHP/Symfony codebase into NextJS allowing for faster development for our React team and providing much faster page loads at a lower server cost.

\item Created Lambdas triggered via SNS events which would clean and persist event logs from our frontend. This provided us with a wealth of data regarding user actions on our platform and could be used by our data scientists to provide insights in new features and their relative value to our users.

\item Migrated AWS EKS cluster to Kubernetes saving resources and giving us finer control. Migrated our primary application from Vagrant to Docker which reduced the complexity and time taken to get the latest build running locally.

\item Wrote automated tests for all of our untested Node services using Jest and added them to our CircleCi and Buildkite pipelines.

\item Wrote GraphQL APIs for our microservices using type-graphql so that our frontend could more easily retrieve required user data.

\end{itemize}

{\bf Software Engineer},
	Spitfire Corporation, Sydney, NSW \hfill December 2018 - July 2019
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 2pt  % reduce space between items

\item Worked with a small team to develop a Portfolio Management System allowing easy access, analysis and management of client portfolios as well as automated insights to guide investment decisions. Created using Flask and hosted on Amazon EC2 instances.

\item Created an application to automate internal workflows using Django and GraphQL removing the need for hours of repeated manual effort per week spent on data entry.

\item Created Django backend accessible via GraphQL API and consumed using Vue and Apollo Client to provide a web client to allow internal staff to kick off serverless workflows and to view and modify their results.

\end{itemize}

{\bf Security Developer},
	Westpac, Sydney, NSW\hfill July 2018 - December 2018

\item Developed a big data pipeline to process and visualize data from a variety of systems saving approximately a week of manual searching and processing for reports each month, written using Apache Spark within Palantir Foundry.

\item Made small updates and maintenance changes to a large Springboot application that was used internally for recording the outcomes of cyber security penetration tests.
